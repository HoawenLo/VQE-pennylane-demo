# Variational quantum eigensolver demonstration with Pennylane

Variational quantum eigensolver is a hybrid classical-quantum algoritm which aims to find the ground state energy level of a quantum system.

Like other variational quantum algorithms, VQE utilises optimisation concecpts from neural networks, to apply to parameterised quantum circuits.
